        <h2>Blog Post #1 AIGA Design Conference Web Design Critique</h2>
        <h3>10/05/2016</h3>
        <p>When I first entered the website for AIGA Design Conference the unbalance color of the
          background caught my eyes first, then the disorientated title. I wasn’t a fan of the color choice
          because I didn’t think red and sky blue goes well together, and the title of the website confused
          me because I wasn’t sure if I should read it horizontally or vertically. The moving image of the
          website was weird and confusing because I wasn’t sure if it has anything to do with the design
          conference. As I was scrolling through the website I can kind of tell that it has something to do
          with the design conference because of the rainbow rocks and the conference pictures. The
          usability of the website was average, nothing interesting buttons I have noticed. The three things
          the website does well was the adding the images setting that allow the user to scroll vertically
          instead of horizontally, providing the information user needed as they scroll through the website,
          and containing a search button that allows the users to search for the information they needed.
          The three things the website didn’t do well was choosing the wrong color, inserting unrelated
          moving image in the background, and selecting disorientated title.</p>

          <h2>Blog Post #2 Coffee Shop Process</h2>
          <h3>10/10/2016</h3>
          <p>The coffee shop exercise was a success because as I was following the directions of the
          of the exercise, I browser check after every step to insure I did not make any errors when I was
          coding. However, I still made mistakes when I was coding CSS on footer and article, I inputted
          the pixel in padding which made my text disappeared. I didn’t understand many tags in CSS and
          HTML such as float, clear, Adobe Photoshop color code, nav, article, and section. I also don’t
          apprehend how big the pixel size is supposed to be. Other than that, I understand more than half
          of what I have done throughout the exercise, everything went very smooth and well; thanks to
          the clear directions. I think I will process in the future to do better next time by reading the
          textbook ahead or google it to comprehend more HTML and CSS tags because everything I need
          to know will be online and in textbook.</p>
