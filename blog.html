        <h2>Blog Post #1 AIGA Design Conference Web Design Critique</h2>
        <h3>10/05/2016</h3>
        <img class="image1"src="https://seattle.aiga.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/aiga-vegas-design-conference-1.jpg"/>
        <p>When I first entered the website for AIGA Design Conference the unbalance color of the
          background caught my eyes first, then the disorientated title. I wasn’t a fan of the color choice
          because I didn’t think red and sky blue goes well together, and the title of the website confused
          me because I wasn’t sure if I should read it horizontally or vertically. The moving image of the
          website was weird and confusing because I wasn’t sure if it has anything to do with the design
          conference. As I was scrolling through the website I can kind of tell that it has something to do
          with the design conference because of the rainbow rocks and the conference pictures. The
          usability of the website was average, nothing interesting buttons I have noticed. The three things
          the website does well was the adding the images setting that allow the user to scroll vertically
          instead of horizontally, providing the information user needed as they scroll through the website,
          and containing a search button that allows the users to search for the information they needed.
          The three things the website didn’t do well was choosing the wrong color, inserting unrelated
          moving image in the background, and selecting disorientated title.</p>

          <h2>Blog Post #2 Coffee Shop Process</h2>
          <h3>10/10/2016</h3>
          <img class="image1"src="images/header01.jpg" height="auto" width="698"/>
          <p>The coffee shop exercise was a success because as I was following the directions of the
          of the exercise, I browser check after every step to insure I did not make any errors when I was
          coding. However, I still made mistakes when I was coding CSS on footer and article, I inputted
          the pixel in padding which made my text disappeared. I didn’t understand many tags in CSS and
          HTML such as float, clear, Adobe Photoshop color code, nav, article, and section. I also don’t
          apprehend how big the pixel size is supposed to be. Other than that, I understand more than half
          of what I have done throughout the exercise, everything went very smooth and well; thanks to
          the clear directions. I think I will process in the future to do better next time by reading the
          textbook ahead or google it to comprehend more HTML and CSS tags because everything I need
          to know will be online and in textbook.</p>

          <h2>Blog Post #3 A-List Apart Article</h2>
          <h3>10/24/2016</h3>
          <img class="image1"src="images/bubbles.jpg" height="auto" width="698"/>
          <p> One essential important information I learned from this article is that having styling
          bubbles in the web page really do enhanced the visual quality of the web. The styling bubbles
          also create the visual hierarchy where you start and stop where the circle is at. I find it interesting
          that the shape placement of the bubbles is really complicated to figure out because it requires
          approximate pixel to position the circle next to the text without covering the text. The article
          taught me that you don’t need non-rectangular float shapes and feature queries. Even though I
          like how the overall layout look but one thing I don’t understand is that will the layout still look
          clean if I include a big block of text next to the circle, and the approximate pixel of the circle
          should be in order to fit next to the text. Overall, I believe this article can help me in the future
          when company hired me to help them create clean organized web page with images, and it will
          make the web page look sophisticated.</p>
