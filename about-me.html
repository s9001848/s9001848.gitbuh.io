          <h1>About Me!</h1>
          <p>My name is Tsung Yen Wu, I prefered be called Jason Wu. I am originally from Taiwan and moved to Los Angeles.
          I came here since I was fourth grade in a city called Diamond Bar. I am a third year
          design major at UC Davis. I am currently going towards the path of web and graphic design
          because I like drawing on the computer creating poster for events. My goal is to work at any company that would accept me into their company.
          I believe that the more company I work with the more experience I will get. Soon, I can start achieving for my dream job which is to start up my own
          company for graphic and web design. My hobbies are playing tennis, drawing, playing computer games, singing, eating, and watching movie.My fantasy is to become a famous singer where I can tour around world like Adele and Beyonce.</p>
          <p>Besides academic and hobbies, I have a dog named Charlie,
          he is a 3 years old pure bred teacup/toy Maltese. He loves playing with people because he thinks
          he is a human being too and refuse to interact with other dogs when come in contact with them. Charlie
          is only 3lbs not because I starve him but because he doesn't eat that much in general. Overall, I think
          if I don't stop believe my dreams, I believe, I will achieve it as long as I work hard with Charlie by my side.
